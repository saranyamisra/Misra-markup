  <p class="body">Welcome to my page! I'm currently at the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism. I've also completed an Advanced Business Certification and an M.A. in International Affairs and Media in Human Rights, both at Columbia University, while interning at the Bureau for Crisis Prevention and Recovery at the United Nations Development Program. Before that, I completed my B.Sc. in Media, Culture and Communication from New York University's Steinhardt School for Culture, Education and Human Development in May 2011, where I graduated with a 3.8 GPA, and a minor in Studio Art. I have worked with organizations such as UNICEF and Amnesty International, in non-profit and marketing fields. 
I'm a classically trained singer and pianist, have travelled to over 30 countries, and I enjoy a good pun.</p>

  <p class="body">This is just a practice for a very interesting coding class, but I hope to expand this into a proper professional web page one day.</p>
